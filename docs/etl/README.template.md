# ETL Orchestrator

## Introduction

This module contains components for implementing elegant ETL operations using the **[OETL Design Pattern](#OETL)**.

## OETL

Short for **Orchestrated Extract-Transform-Load** is a pattern that takes the ideas behind variations of the 
Model-View-Whatever design pattern

![Orchestrated ETL](etl-orchestrator.png)

The **Orchestrator** is responsible for conducting the interactions between the 
**Extractor** -> **Transformer** -> **Loader**.

The **Ochestrator** reads data from the **Extractor** then uses the result as a parameter to calling the **Transformer**
and saves the transformed result into the **Loader**. The **Transformer** can be optional as there are scenarios where 
data transformation is not needed (i.e. raw data ingestion to a landing zone)

Each layer may have a single or multiple implementations, and this is handled automatically in the 
**Orchestrator**

## Orchestration Fluent Interface

This library provides common simple implementations and base classes for implementing the OETL design pattern. 
To simplify object construction, we provide the **Orchestrator** fluent interface from `spetlr.etl`

```python
from spetlr.etl import Extractor, Transformer, Loader, Orchestrator

(Orchestrator()
    .extract_from(Extractor())
    .transform_with(Transformer())
    .load_into(Loader())
    .execute())
```

### Principles

All ETL classes, **Orchestrator**, **Extractor**, **Transformer** and **Loader** are ETL objects.
This means that they have a method `etl(self, inputs: dataset_group) -> dataset_group`
(where `dataset_group = Dict[str, DataFrame]`) that transforms a set of import to a set of 
outputs. The special properties of each type are
 - **Extractor** always adds its result to the total set,
 - **Transformer** consumes all inputs and adds a single result dataframe,
 - **Loader** acts as a sink, while passing its input on to the next sink,

The special case of the  **Orchestrator** is that it takes all its steps and executes them
in sequence on its inputs. Running in the default `execute()` method, the inputs are empty,
but an orchestrator can also be added as part of another orchestrator with the `step` method.

For the most general case of a many-to-many transformation, implement your step by inheriting
from the `EtlBase` class.


## Usage examples:

Here are some example usages and implementations of the ETL class provided

### Example-1

Here's an example of reading data from a single location, transforming it once and saving to a single destination.
This is the most simple etl case, and will be used as base for the below more complex examples.

```
{basic_example}
```

The code above produces the following output:

```
Original DataFrame schema
root
 |-- id: string (nullable = true)
 |-- brand: string (nullable = true)
 |-- model: string (nullable = true)
 |-- year: string (nullable = true)

New DataFrame schema
root
 |-- id: integer (nullable = true)
 |-- brand: string (nullable = true)
 |-- model: string (nullable = true)
 |-- year: integer (nullable = true)

+---+------+----------+----+
| id| brand|     model|year|
+---+------+----------+----+
|  1|Fender|Telecaster|1950|
|  2|Gibson|  Les Paul|1959|
|  3|Ibanez|        RG|1987|
+---+------+----------+----+
```

### Example-2

Here's an example of having multiple `Transformer` implementations that is reused to change the data type of a given column,
where the column name is parameterized.

```
{multiple_transform_example}
```

### Example-3

Here's an example of having multiple `Extractor` implementations and applying transformations using 
the `process_many` method.

The `read()` function in `Extractor` will return a dictionary that uses the type name of the `Extractor` 
as the key, and a `DataFrame` as its value, the used kan can be overridden in the constructor.

`Transformer` provides the function `process_many(datasets: dataset_group)` and returns a single `DataFrame`.

```
{multiple_input_example}
```

The code above produces the following output:

```
root
 |-- id: string (nullable = true)
 |-- brand: string (nullable = true)
 |-- model: string (nullable = true)
 |-- year: string (nullable = true)
 |-- country: string (nullable = false)

+---+--------+----------+----+-------+
| id|   brand|     model|year|country|
+---+--------+----------+----+-------+
|  1|  Fender|Telecaster|1950|    USA|
|  2|  Gibson|  Les Paul|1959|    USA|
|  3|  Ibanez|        RG|1987|  Japan|
|  4|Takamine|Pro Series|1959|  Japan|
+---+--------+----------+----+-------+
```

### Example-4

Here's an example of data raw ingestion without applying any transformations.

```
{no_transform_example}
```

### Example-5

Here's an example of having multiple `Loader` implementations that is writing the transformed data into multiple destinations.

```
{multiple_output_example}
```

### Example-6

Using [Example-2](#Example-2), [Example-3](#Example-3) and [Example-5](#Example-5) as reference,
any combinations for single/multiple implementations of `Extractor`, `Transformer` or `Loader` can be created.

Here's an example of having both multiple `Extractor`, `Transformer` and `Loader` implementations.

It is important that the first transformer is a `MultiInputTransformer` when having multiple extractors.

```
{multi_multi_example}
```

### Example-7

This example illustrates the use of `TransformerNC`.
The job here is to join the two extracted dataframes - an employees dataframe and a birthdays dataframe.
But, before the birthdays can be joined onto the employees, the employees dataframe require a transformation step.
As the transformation step of employees is handled by an `TransformerNC`, it does not consume the other inputs from the `dataset_group`.
Hence, birthdays is still available from the inputs - even after the transformation of employees.
Then both frames can be joined and the final dataframe saved via an `Loader`.
When working with `TransformerNC` it is important to mind that dataset keys are crucial.
Setting both input and output dataset key(s) ensure that the `Transformers` and `Loaders` handle the intended dataframes.

```
{etl_nc_example}
```

### Example-8

This example illustrates the use of an orchestrator as just another ETL step.
The principle is called composit orchestration:

```
{composit_orchestration_example}
```
